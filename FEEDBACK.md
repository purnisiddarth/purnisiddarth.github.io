Developer Site - suggestions

1. Guided tutorials - I would add a simple html/js working sample in addition to the sample in GitHub. As an engineer coming from the world of .Net using Microsoft tools, GitHub presents a learning curve which I tried to conquer by looking at GitHub tutorials while I wanted to focus on Uber tutorials. 

Having a working sample embedded in the guided tutorials page makes the site more inclusive of engineers from all backgrounds without making assumptions about tools he/she is familiar with. 

2. I would introduce a samples section to show how to use time/price endpoints. Seeing a simple implementation goes a long way in making it welcoming for a new user. Further steps to improve could include inviting users to submit their samples.  

3. Authentication and Authorization section was very helpful up until step 3. Having gotten the authorization code, the section was not very helpful in getting the token. My views are purely based on how I looked for answers being someone who does not know curl/GitHub, etc. I would add sample calls that users could try on a tool like Advanced REST client for Chrome, which is how I figured out the way to get access token. 

4. Standardize the code/sample throughout the site and add screenshots. Links to GitHub repositories give the users the option to pick samples in languages they are familiar with. Tutorials section can have a table that has links to GitHub repositories for various languages. 

API - Suggestions

1. Make more endpoints available in the sandbox. This will help in adding more details to the sandbox documentation with end-to-end samples.

2. Add more properties to the results for time/price endpoints. As a mother of 2, I would like to use Uber to go places, but I would need to know if the Uber car has car seats or not. This could be a simple true/false property or it can be a new product called Uber for Moms, similar to UberWAV. Moms would like to go places with their kids, with the ease of someone else driving and focusing on the road and not have to deal with parking hassles. 

3. Add more examples in different languages, one cannot assume that all users can follow python/NodeJs/Curl syntax
